## About this website

This website is currently a work in progress. To make it easier to know which pages have already been completed, all non-completed pages have a temporary label before their titles:

- Pages with some content, but not yet finished, have `"(*)"`
- Pages with no content have `"(x)"`

<!-- Status (to do/in progress/done) for the different pages is managed through these projects:

- [Complete docs](https://github.com/GraphQLByPoP/graphql-by-pop.com/projects/1)
- [Complete guides](https://github.com/GraphQLByPoP/graphql-by-pop.com/projects/3) -->
