Starting from today, I will be publishing a series of articles for the [Log Rocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com) concerning the conceptualization, design and implementation of a GraphQL server. All these articles describe the foundations of GraphQL by PoP: how it works, why it works like that, which were the priorities, what are the trade-offs, and others.

The first article is out now: [Designing a GraphQL server for optimal performance](https://blog.logrocket.com/designing-graphql-server-optimal-performance/).
